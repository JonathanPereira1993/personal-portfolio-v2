            <p className="text-lg dark:text-[#a0a0a0] font-light">
              With 2+ years of experience working at a tech company, I was
              fortunate to learn front-end working with Outsystems (Low-code
              development platform), helping my client‚Äôs UX/UI teams . Besides
              Outsystems, I also write code like Javascript and do the styling
              using CSS and SCSS. On my spare time, I am dedicated to learn more
              about other programming languages and ways to improve my corporate
              job. I‚Äôm currently working in some personal projects made with
              ReactJs, TailwindCSS and I am constantly challenging myself to do
              more and better everyday.

            <p className="text-lg dark:text-[#a0a0a0] font-light">
              Before jumping into the web development world, I studied Web
              Development and Multimedia and after that, I enrolled in the Games
              and Multimedia bachelor's degree. With this academic experience, I
              was introduced to the digital world by learning from the basics to
              more complex and challenging matters. I had the opportunity to do
              some web projects, design, art, programming and more importantly,
              i had the chance to prepare myself for the corporate world,
              working on major final projects.
